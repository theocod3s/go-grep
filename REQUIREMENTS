//--Summary:
// Create a grep clone that can do simple substring searching
// within files. It must auto-recurse into subdirectories.
//
//--Requirements:
//_ Use goroutines to search through the files for a substring match
//_ Display matches to the terminal as they are found
// _ Display the line number, file path, and complete line containing the match
//_ Recurse into any subdirectories looking for matches
//_ Use any synchronization method to ensure that all files
// are searched, and all results are displayed before the program
// terminates.
//
//--Notes:
//_ Program invocation should follow the pattern:
// mgrep search_string search_dir
